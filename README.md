OpenMV Code for 2021 FRC Season


The test directory holds individual programs we used to figure out
how to sense certain field elements and talk to various IO. 

The lib directory holds libraries we write to provide protocols
and device interfaces in the main applications.

The app directory holds the "main programs" that we run on different
sensor pods depending on their role in the system.
